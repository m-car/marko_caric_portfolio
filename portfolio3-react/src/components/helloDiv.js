      <p>Being a web developer means being part of a community. 
        This is my place not only to show my projects, 
        but also share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.
        I found an interest in web development and have been learning fast. 
        I will be updating this site as I progress through my web development journey.
      </p>
      <p>Take a look around at some of my projects I have been working on as I develop my skills.</p>
